# SSMIF-Coding-Challenge-Fall-2023
Quantitative Investments Coding Challenge

The challenge provided one week to complete two significant projects based on the quantitative analysis of financial assets.
## DataFrame Cleaning for Portfolio
Focused on Filling missing data and deleting Unnecessary Data.

Calculated Net Asset Value and the liquidity of all of the Portfolio's assets. 
## Algorithmic Trading Strategy
Developed an Algorithmic Trading Strategy based on an LSTM neural network to forecast future prices based on previous market data.

The program also makes sure to properly allocate the financial assets based on Hierarchal Risk Parity to ensure that the stocks
are diverse and produce the highest reward given the lowest amount of risk(Sharpe Ratio).

Thank You!
